## Covid Report
The Covied Report visualizes the datasets of covid-19 cases so users will have an easier time viewing how much cases and deaths had occured. I will highlight that the total number of US cases is `r get_total_cases()`. And, the total number of US deaths is `r get_total_deaths()`. 


I also want to show the chart:
``` {r echo=FALSE}
cases_plot
```
